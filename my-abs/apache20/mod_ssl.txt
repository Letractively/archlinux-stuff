To use apache with SSL you will have to do three things:

1) Edit /etc/conf.d/httpd and set HTTPD_USE_SSL to "yes"

2) Create an ssl key, request, and certificate.

  # This generates the cert and key (valid for 3650 days)
  # Be sure to enter the FQDN of your apache server as the "Common Name".
  openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:1024 -days 3650 \
    -keyout server.key -out server.crt
  # This will remove the passphrase
  openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key
  
3) Modify /etc/httpd/conf/ssl.conf to use your new certificate.

   SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/conf/server.crt
   SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/conf/server.key

Done! You can start apache with '/etc/rc.d/httpd start'.  If it hangs or fails
to start, check the /var/log/httpd/error_log or try running
'/usr/sbin/apachectl startssl' and looking for errors/prompts.
