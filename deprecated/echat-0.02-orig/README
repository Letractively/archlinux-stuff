##  what is eChat

    eChat is a serverless messaging system dedicated to
    chat and messages exchange over the TCP/IP networks

    compatible with Vypress Chat and quickChat for Windows9x/ME/NT/2000/XP


##  installation

    download from: http://deep.perm.ru/files/echat/
    or from: http://www.vypress.com/products/chat/unix/

    % edit Makefile for your system
    note: you'll need ncurses library
        (ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/ncurses)

    % make
    % make install

    % cp /usr/local/doc/.echatrc.sample ~/.echatrc

    % edit ~/.echatrc
    % echat

    my recommendation to use open, for example:
    % open -c11 /usr/local/bin/echat

##  tips

    - if your nick change activity without your action - refresh users list
    - you can silently change autoanswer by `/answer <new autoanswer>' command
    - if you use `/!' command with some output - you'll need press ^R
    - `echat -d' will show compile defines
    - when -DTCP enabled you can telnet to echat port from any machine
